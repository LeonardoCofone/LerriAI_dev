    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Last Updated: November 20, 2025</p>
</header>

<main>
<section>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how LerriAI ("we", "our", "the Application") collects, uses, stores, shares, and protects your personal data when you use our personal assistant application. LerriAI is designed to help you manage and automate personal and professional tasks by integrating with Google services including Gmail, Google Drive, Google Calendar, Google Tasks, Google Contacts, Google Documents, and Google Sheets.</p>
    <p>This Privacy Policy is provided in compliance with the Google API Services User Data Policy, Google APIs Terms of Service, and applicable data protection laws. By using LerriAI, you consent to the data practices described in this policy.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>1. Data Accessed</h2>
    <p>LerriAI accesses the following types of Google user data through the Google API Services to provide its core functionality. Access to this data is only granted after you explicitly authorize the Application through Google's OAuth 2.0 authentication process.</p>
    
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Google Service</th>
            <th>API Scope</th>
            <th>Data Accessed</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Google Account</td>
            <td>userinfo.email<br>userinfo.profile</td>
            <td>Your email address and basic profile information (name, profile picture) to identify your account and personalize your experience.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Gmail</td>
            <td>gmail.send</td>
            <td>Permission to send emails on your behalf. The Application can compose and send emails when you explicitly request this action through commands such as "Send an email to [recipient]".</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Google Drive</td>
            <td>drive.file</td>
            <td>Access to files and folders that you explicitly create with or open with the Application. This scope allows the Application to read, modify, create, and delete only those files that you directly interact with through LerriAI, not your entire Drive.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Google Calendar</td>
            <td>calendar.readonly</td>
            <td>Read-only access to your calendar events and metadata. The Application can view your calendar entries to answer queries such as "What are my appointments today?" or "Check my schedule for next week".</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Google Documents</td>
            <td>documents</td>
            <td>Permission to view and manage Google Docs that you create with or open with the Application. This allows the Application to create, read, and edit documents when you request actions like "Create a new document" or "Update my notes".</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Google Sheets</td>
            <td>spreadsheets</td>
            <td>Permission to view and manage Google Sheets that you create with or open with the Application. This enables the Application to create, read, update, and manage spreadsheets when you request data organization or analysis tasks.</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <div class="important">
        <strong>Important:</strong> The Application only accesses data from the specific Google services listed above and only when necessary to fulfill your explicit requests. We do not access any other Google services or data beyond what is described in this policy.
    </div>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>2. Data Usage</h2>
    <p>LerriAI uses the Google user data it accesses exclusively to provide the personal assistant functionality you request. Specifically, the data is used for the following purposes:</p>
    
    <h3>2.1 Command Processing and Task Execution</h3>
    <p>When you issue a command to LerriAI (such as "Schedule a meeting tomorrow at 10 AM" or "Find my flight receipt"), the Application processes your request using AI agents that:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Analyze your command to understand the intent and required actions</li>
        <li>Access the relevant Google services to retrieve necessary information</li>
        <li>Execute the requested actions on your behalf</li>
        <li>Provide you with confirmation and results of the completed task</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2.2 Personalization and Context</h3>
    <p>The Application maintains a temporary conversation context during your session to provide coherent and contextually relevant responses. This includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Remembering the current conversation flow to handle follow-up questions</li>
        <li>Storing user preferences and settings you configure within the Application</li>
        <li>Maintaining a minimal set of personal data (such as your name and email) to personalize interactions</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2.3 Daily Briefing Generation</h3>
    <p>If you enable the daily briefing feature, the Application accesses your calendar data to generate a summary of your upcoming appointments and tasks. This briefing is created on-demand and is not stored permanently.</p>

    <h3>2.4 Technical Operations</h3>
    <p>The Application uses your Google account credentials (OAuth tokens) to authenticate and authorize API requests to Google services. These tokens are securely stored and used only to maintain your authenticated session.</p>

    <div class="important">
        <strong>Limitation of Use:</strong> LerriAI uses your Google user data solely to provide the features and functionality you explicitly request. We do not use your data for any other purposes, including advertising, marketing, data mining, profiling, or any activities unrelated to the core functionality of the Application.
    </div>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>3. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>LerriAI is committed to protecting your privacy and does not share your Google user data with third parties, except as described below:</p>

    <h3>3.1 No Third-Party Sharing for Marketing or Advertising</h3>
    <p>We do not sell, rent, trade, or otherwise share your personal data with third parties for marketing, advertising, or any commercial purposes unrelated to the functionality of the Application.</p>

    <h3>3.2 Service Providers</h3>
    <p>The Application uses the following service providers to deliver its functionality:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Google API Services:</strong> Your data is transmitted to Google's servers to execute API requests when you use features that interact with Gmail, Drive, Calendar, Documents, and Sheets. This data transmission is necessary for the Application to function and is governed by Google's Privacy Policy.</li>
        <li><strong>Anthropic API:</strong> User commands and requests are processed using Anthropic's Claude AI model to understand intent and generate appropriate responses. We transmit only the minimum necessary information (your command and relevant context) to Anthropic's API. No complete emails, documents, or files are sent to Anthropic unless specifically required to fulfill your request. Anthropic's data handling is governed by their privacy policy.</li>
        <li><strong>Cloud Hosting Provider:</strong> The Application backend is hosted on a cloud server infrastructure. Server logs and operational data may be stored by the hosting provider for technical maintenance and security purposes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3.3 Legal Requirements</h3>
    <p>We may disclose your personal data if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (such as a court order or government agency), including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.</p>

    <h3>3.4 No Data Brokers or Analytics</h3>
    <p>We do not share your data with data brokers, analytics companies, or advertising networks. The Application does not include third-party tracking, analytics, or advertising SDKs.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>4. Data Storage and Protection</h2>
    
    <h3>4.1 Storage Practices</h3>
    <p>LerriAI stores the following types of data on our secure backend servers:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Authentication Tokens:</strong> OAuth 2.0 access tokens and refresh tokens provided by Google are securely stored to maintain your authenticated session. These tokens are encrypted and stored in a secure database.</li>
        <li><strong>User Account Information:</strong> Basic account details including your email address and name are stored to identify your account and personalize your experience.</li>
        <li><strong>User Preferences and Settings:</strong> Configuration settings and preferences you set within the Application are stored in JSON format on our servers (in the data/ directory).</li>
        <li><strong>Minimal Session Data:</strong> Temporary conversation context is maintained during active sessions to provide coherent responses to your commands.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>What We Do NOT Store:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Complete email contents from Gmail</li>
        <li>Full documents or files from Google Drive</li>
        <li>Complete calendar event details beyond what is necessary for temporary processing</li>
        <li>Sensitive file contents from Google Documents or Sheets</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Data retrieved from Google services is processed in real-time to fulfill your requests and is not permanently stored on our servers.</p>

    <h3>4.2 Security Measures</h3>
    <p>We implement industry-standard security measures to protect your data:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Encryption in Transit:</strong> All data transmitted between the Application, Google services, and AI providers is encrypted using HTTPS/TLS protocols.</li>
        <li><strong>Encryption at Rest:</strong> Authentication tokens and sensitive user data stored on our servers are encrypted using industry-standard encryption algorithms.</li>
        <li><strong>Access Controls:</strong> Access to backend systems and databases is restricted to authorized personnel only and protected by strong authentication mechanisms.</li>
        <li><strong>Secure Authentication:</strong> The Application uses Google's OAuth 2.0 authentication protocol, which ensures that we never have access to your Google account password.</li>
        <li><strong>Regular Security Updates:</strong> We regularly update our systems and dependencies to address known security vulnerabilities.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4.3 Data Location</h3>
    <p>Your data is stored on servers located in secure data centers. The Application backend operates on cloud infrastructure, and data may be processed in different geographic locations depending on the service provider's infrastructure.</p>
